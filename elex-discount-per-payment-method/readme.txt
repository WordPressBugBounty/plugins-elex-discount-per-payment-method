== Description ==
It will be a pleasant little surprise for customers if you offer a discount based on the payment method they have chosen on the Checkout page. The ELEX WooCommerce Discount per Payment Method Plugin allows you to offer discounts on your WooCommerce store based on the payment method chosen by customers.

There are a lot of payment methods available in the industry. Some are preferable for customers, while some are advantageous for merchants. This plugin will help you set up discounts on payment methods, which will help you encourage your customers to choose the advantageous one over other payment options. 

Sometimes, you would like to receive the payment through digital payment methods rather than cash on delivery option. In such cases, you can provide discounts based on digital payment methods. Also, do not forget to display those exclusive offers to catch the eyes of customers!

If you are planning to run any special promotion or scheme for a specific payment method in your store, integrating this plugin will be a great idea to make customers choose the respective payment method. 

Moreover, discounts will attract potential customers to choose your store over and over. Thereby, increase the sales flow towards your store with this simple, yet robust plugin.
